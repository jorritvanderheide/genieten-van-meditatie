      <h3>Why does dieting not work?</h3>
      <em>
        For at least eight years I had been busy counting calories, exercising to get rid of the calories again and
        avoiding situations where I had to eat. I know the struggle with eating and non-eating inside and out. That's
        why I am so motivated to help you if you are struggling with an eating disorder.
      </em>
      <p>
        Often you do manage to lose kilos when you diet, but over time they come back - and even more than those you
        lost.
      </p>
      <p>Why does this happen?</p>
      <p>There are several reasons:</p>
      <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>
          <h4>Dieting often means that you are not listening to your body...</h4>
          <p>During dieting you are focused more than ever on eating, calories, on losing weight and denying yourself
            many things. In fact, dieting is based on a fight with your body: you will ‘manage’ your body and show it
            that you are stronger. Dieting is mostly not based on a loving connection with your body and on listening to
            what it needs; on listening to when it is hungry and to when it is satisfied. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Your being overweight is just a symptom...</h4>
          <p>When you have a natural connection with yourself and with your feelings, then you will not be overweight.
            Being overweight is just a symptom of a hunger for fulfillment. Emotions which are too threatening to feel
            can be suppressed either by overeating or not eating. This may once have been a good survival strategy, but
            there comes a time when it doesn’t work any more. Then it is necessary to start feeling those feelings. And
            yes, you have to go through 'the shit' first in order to also start feeling pleasant feelings. The way
            towards this is not only doom and gloom, but can finally be very fulfilling. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Being overweight also has advantages...</h4>
          <p>If you look deeper, carrying excess weight also has advantages: it can give you a sense of protection, a
            sense of solidity, a sort of cocoon around you which feels safe. And if you look deeper, both overeating and
            being overweight have a lot of other functions. If you start dieting you step over those benefits, but the
            advantages of being overweight remain present in the basement of your being and from there, once you have
            reached your 'ideal weight', an irresistable impulse to increase it arises again.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Then what is needed? </h4>
      <p>I know what you are going through when you have an eating problem from my own experience of anorexia, bulimia
        and overeating.</p>
      <p>What is needed is a loving attitude to who you are right now, exactly as you are, and to start looking from
        there, with love and compassion, at what is happening inside of you. What is needed most of all is not to diet,
        because this operates on a very superficial level, with the effect that almost always the eating problem becomes
        worse.</p>
