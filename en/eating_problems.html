        <h4>An eating problem is only a symptom</h4>
        <p>
          When the focus on food had disappeared from my life, and passion and joy had come in its place, I could look back on what had helped me.
          Based on my experience, I developed the following guidance to help others to get rid of their eating problem:
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe you have already tried many things to leave your eating problem behind, amongst which dieting is most probably included.</p>

        <p>To make your way out of an eating disorder takes time, patience and an attuned approach involving your body, your heart and your being.</p>
        <p>
          The following is what I offer, based on how I came out of my own eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia and overeating) myself, and on my
          experience as a medical doctor.

        <h3>8-week online course with personal guidance</h3>
        <p>
          The online course 'Beyond Eating Problems' is a course of 8 weeks with many practical exercises and meditations that help you to leave your
          eating disorder behind:
        </p>

        <ul class="fa-ul geschenk">
          <li>
            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-fire"></i></span>8 lessons with practical exercises and meditations
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-fire"></i></span>with my personal guidance
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I guide this course by giving feedback, adjusting the exercises if necessary, sometimes inserting new exercises and (if desired) providing
          consultations.
        </p>

        <h4>Structure, self-love, contact with your emotions, finding your passion</h4>
        <p>
          The online course 'Beyond Eating Problems' is a course of 8 weeks with many practical exercises and meditations that help you to leave your
          eating disorder behind.
        </p>
        <p>This of course is also dependent on your own commitment and motivation.</p>

        <h4>Additionally: a family constellation</h4>
        <p>
          In this process a family constellation is recommended, because an eating problem is often related to entanglements in your family system.

        <h3>Live consultations in between</h3>
        <p>
          Many people prefer to have a consultation with me every few weeks alongside the online course. This is possible online via Zoom or live at
          my home, keeping a distance from each other of 1,5 meters.
        </p>
        <p>The fee is €65,00 for a consultation of one hour.</p>
